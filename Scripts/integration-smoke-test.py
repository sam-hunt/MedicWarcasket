# Pre-release integration smoke test: boots the real game once with Medic
# Warcasket, its dependency chain and the optional mods it patches for, on a
# pinned minimal list where the baseline is a clean log, then classifies
# every logged error/warning by origin and fails on anything attributed to
# this mod or an integration seam. Thin shim over the shared engine in
# l10n/smoke/startup_smoke.py (see its header for mechanics and the
# BetterTradersGuild v1.1.0 CWTL incident this exists to catch).
#
# Run this before every release, with the game closed:
#   python3 Scripts/integration-smoke-test.py              # boot + scan
#   python3 Scripts/integration-smoke-test.py --no-launch  # rescan last log
#   python3 Scripts/integration-smoke-test.py --strict     # any error fails

# RATIONALE: the first five entries are the l10n CANONICAL_ACTIVE_MODS (the
# refresh shim explains them: VFE Pirates is the hard dep, VEF and Harmony
# are its deps, Vanilla Gravship Expanded requires Odyssey). Then the
# optional mods this repo integrates with. Vanilla Gravship Expanded
# (chapter 1): LoadFolders.xml opens the 1.6/Mods/VanillaGravshipExpanded
# root on its package id, and that root's vacuum-resistance patch only ever
# runs with it active. Combat Extended: it opens the 1.6/Mods/CombatExtended
# root, whose patch rescales the set's stats and would fail silently against
# a renamed node. It loads after VFEP, where its own About.xml puts it. Each
# sits before our mod, as the mod a compat root complements should. Probe
# last (auto-quit). Plain ids on purpose; see the refresh shim's "_steam"
# note.
# Save Our Ship 2 is deliberately absent: 1.6/Patches/SOS2Patch.xml is a
# best-effort mirror of VFEP's own patch (its header), checked statically by
# Tests/1.6/CompatPatchTests.cs and never booted here.
