// Mod entry point. Applies every [HarmonyPatch] class in this assembly, then runs the
// def-derived startup work (Startup.Run: the settings' defaults and overrides) for this first
// load; later play-data reloads run it again through the CallAll postfix.
//
// Deliberately a [StaticConstructorOnStartup] rather than a Mod-subclass constructor:
// Mod constructors run BEFORE any defs are loaded, and applying a Harmony patch
// JIT-compiles the target and runs its declaring type's static constructor. This mod
// exists to extend another mod (VFE Pirates), so its patch targets will often live in
// VFEPirates.dll, and a VFEP type whose static ctor resolves defs would be permanently
// broken by an early patch. Static constructors on startup run after all defs have
// loaded, which makes foreign-target patches safe here without any deferral machinery,
// and is the first point the settings can reach the defs they override. Keep PatchAll here
// rather than in MedicWarcasketMod's constructor.
