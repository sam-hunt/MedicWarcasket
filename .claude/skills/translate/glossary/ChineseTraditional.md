# Traditional Chinese glossary, Medic Warcasket

Seeded from the Shipcracker Warcasket glossary (machine-assisted there, no
native review yet); no translation pass has run here yet. Mod-specific terms
and grounding decisions only; family-wide mechanics, punctuation rules and
the zh-Hant/zh-Hans inversion table live in `l10n/languages/ChineseTraditional.md`.

**Community VFEP source.** The Workshop pack "Vanilla Factions Expanded - Pirates - 簡&繁中文漢化包"
(id 2727638702) attests the noun 戰棺 on its page, but its Traditional files
could not be obtained. The file-confirmed lineage is the zh-Hans pack (GitHub
q847633684/Vanilla-Expanded-ZH): 战棺, `<set>型战棺装甲` / `<set>型战棺护肩` /
`<set>型战棺头盔`, 战棺铸造厂. Terms marked "derived" are Traditional forms of
that pack's terms, each checked character by character against the zh-Hant
Core/Royalty/Odyssey tars (not a script conversion). The page's 無畏戰棺 prefix
is deliberately not used.

## Inherited rows (shared with Shipcracker Warcasket; change them there first)

| English | Traditional Chinese | Grounding / notes |
|---|---|---|
| warcasket | 戰棺 | Attested on the community pack's page; zh-Hans files use 战棺. Workshop title anchor. |
| `<set>` warcasket / shoulders / helmet (label pattern) | `<set>`型戰棺裝甲 / `<set>`型戰棺護肩 / `<set>`型戰棺頭盔 | Derived from the zh-Hans pack's pattern. 頭盔 and 裝甲 match vanilla (Core `Apparel_PowerArmorHelmet` 海陸頭盔, 海陸裝甲). |
| pauldrons / shoulder pads | 護肩 | Derived (zh-Hans 护肩, also the foundry UI's `VFEP.Shoulderpads`). |
| torso piece (Workshop) | 裝甲主體 | Derived from the foundry UI's `VFEP.ArmorFrame` (装甲主体). |
| shell (warcasket torso) | 外殼 | Core `Shell.label`, Royalty cataphract helmet 防護外殼. |
| warcasket foundry | 戰棺鑄造廠 | Derived (zh-Hans 战棺铸造厂); 鑄造廠 is Core `FoundryApprentice76`. |
| Siegebreaker / Brute / Guardian / Aerial (set names) | 破襲型 / 狂怒型 / 聖盾型 / 空襲型 | Derived from the zh-Hans pack; 空襲型 is coined there, unverified. |
| entombed / welded into the set (Workshop) | 封在戰棺內; assembling at the foundry 組裝 | zh-Hans pack's `VFEP.WarcasketText` (封入, 组装) rather than a literal "weld". |
| specialized spacer-tech | 特化型太空科技 | 特化型 from the zh-Hans pack's descriptions; 太空科技 is Core `Synthread.description`. |
| respirator | 呼吸器 | Odyssey rulestrings (組裝呼吸器). |
| Imperial | 帝國 | Royalty cataphract descriptions (帝國的甲冑騎士). |
| chemfuel | 化合燃料 | Core label. |
| jobReportString (`Using ability: {0}`) | 使用能力：{0} | Shipcracker's rendering. |
| cooldownGerund (`on cooldown`) | 冷卻 | Shipcracker's rendering of the same vanilla comp field. |
| tank (the armor's fuel tank, settings) | 燃料箱 | Odyssey `FuelStorage.label` 燃料箱 (Core Keyed 燃料槽 is the fueling port); if a tank ever lands here. |
| Default: {0}. / (default) / Off | 預設值：{0}。 / (預設) / 關閉 | Core Keyed `Default` 預設, `Off` 關閉; 預設值 per the Taiwan register list. |
| requires Odyssey (suffix) | (需要「漫遊」DLC) | Core `SimulateNotOwning*` 「漫遊」DLC. ASCII parens set solid, so the suffix drops the English leading space. |
| Workshop title | `<set>`型戰棺 | Contains 戰棺. Also the `MDWC_SettingsCategory` value (title coupling). |

## Charge nouns

No reload comp yet. If an ability lands with a `chargeNoun`, it is shown
only through `{CHARGENOUN_plural}` and `{lookup: ...}` slots (see the
skill), and Chinese falls to the base `Pluralize` (lookup, else unchanged), so one noun serves every slot and no lookup file is needed. Shipcracker's "fuel unit" row in its glossary
is the worked example for this language.

## To ground in the first pass

- siegebreaker (the chassis, lore paragraph 3): the inherited set-name row above.
- the 10th-generation paragraph: derive from the zh-Hans pack's Siegebreaker / Brute / Guardian / Sarcophagus / Controller descriptions, which share it verbatim.
- medic (this set's name) and the Workshop title.
- pilot (the wearer, every description), where no inherited row covers it.
- Core medical vocabulary once the abilities exist: tend, medicine, surgery, bleeding, infection, pain, and whatever hediffs or stats the final text names.
- This mod's coinages, once the descriptions are final.

## Pending native review

Every "derived" term above: converted from the zh-Hans pack and
character-checked against the zh-Hant tars, but the actual Traditional pack
could not be compared. Add this mod's own coinages here as the pass makes them.
