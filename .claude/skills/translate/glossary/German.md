# German glossary, Medic Warcasket

Seeded from the Shipcracker Warcasket glossary (machine-assisted there,
pending native review); no translation pass has run here yet. Only
mod-specific coinages and grounding decisions; family-wide mechanics and
style live in `l10n/languages/German.md`.

**No community VFEP German translation could be grounded against.** A
Workshop pack "Vanilla Factions Expanded - Pirates Deutsch" (id 2810180496)
exists, but its page shows none of its terms and its files were not
available. Every VFEP term below is therefore coined in the Shipcracker repo
and inherited here. If that pack's files turn up, re-ground against them in
the Shipcracker glossary first and prefer its renderings.

## Inherited rows (shared with Shipcracker Warcasket; change them there first)

| English | German | Grounding |
|---|---|---|
| warcasket (coined) | Kriegssarg (m.), pl. Kriegssärge | Literal war + coffin, mirroring the English compound and vanilla's war- → Kriegs- pattern (`MeleeWeapon_Zeushammer` = Kriegshammer). Does not collide with Core's coffin furniture (`Sarcophagus` = Sarkophag). Masculine, so the Gender-table miss default is correct. |
| compound rule for Kriegssarg | always hyphenated to a set name or part: `<Set>`-Kriegssarg, Kriegssarg-Helm, Kriegssarg-Hülle, Kriegssarg-Schulterpanzer, Kriegssarg-Gießerei | Durchkopplung once a set prefix is present; kept uniform in descriptions too so labels and prose match. |
| `<set>` warcasket / shoulders / helmet (label pattern) | `<Set>`-Kriegssarg / `<Set>`-Kriegssarg-Schulterpanzer / `<Set>`-Kriegssarg-Helm | VFEP's `<set> warcasket <part>` label pattern. |
| pauldrons / shoulders / shoulder pads | Schulterpanzer | Ordinary German armor term; "Schultern" alone reads as the body part. |
| warcasket shell | Kriegssarg-Hülle | Per the compound rule. |
| warcasket foundry (coined) | Kriegssarg-Gießerei | foundry = Gießerei per Core `FoundryApprentice76.title` = Gießereilehrling. |
| entomb (coined) | einsargen | Real German verb (to put into a coffin), derived directly from Kriegssarg. The Workshop page's "weld" stays einschweißen, as in English. |
| spacer warcaskets (VFEP research, cited in prose) | 'Raumfahrt-Kriegssärge' | Core `TechLevel_Spacer` = Raumfahrt; single-quoted as a cited label per the language file. Render `specialised warcaskets` in the same shape. |
| VFEP set names (coined) | Belagerungsbrecher (siegebreaker), Rohling (brute), Wächter (guardian), Kontrolleur (controller), Sarkophag (sarcophagus), Luft-Kriegssarg (aerial) | Plain renderings, pending native review there. |
| spacer-tech | aus der Raumfahrttechnik | Core `Plasteel.description` / `Synthread.description` render "spacer-tech" exactly so. |
| Imperial | imperial (imperiale, imperialen ...) | Royalty `PawnKinds_Empire` (imperialer Grenadier). |
| respirator / breathing | Atemgerät / Atmen, Atemleistung | Odyssey research story "Atemgeräten"; Core `Breathing` = Atmen. |
| sealed | luftdicht versiegelt | Odyssey `GravshipHull.description` "luftdichte Wand". |
| chemfuel | Sprit | Core's chemfuel label. |
| mod (noun) | die Mod | Core Keyed `ModLoadFolder...` "About.xml der Mod". |
| jobReportString (`Using ability: {0}`) | setzt Fähigkeit '{0}' ein. | Shipcracker's rendering. |
| cooldownGerund (`on cooldown`) | klingt gerade ab | Shipcracker's rendering of the same vanilla comp field. |
| Off / On / default (settings) | Aus / an / Standard | Core Keyed `Off`, `On`, `Default`; "When enabled/disabled" = Wenn aktiviert / Wenn deaktiviert after Core `CommandAllowCutDesc`. |
| cooldown / cells | Abklingzeit / Zellen | Core Keyed `CooldownTime`, `MapSizeDesc`. |
| Odyssey (DLC) | Odyssey | Core `ExpansionDef` `Odyssey.label` keeps the English name. |
| Workshop title | `<Set>`-Kriegssarg, byte-identical to the body label | Contains Kriegssarg. Also the `MDWC_SettingsCategory` value (title coupling). |

## Charge nouns

The armor's medicine suite has the `chargeNoun` "dose" (its row is *pass*,
below the inherited rows). A charge noun is shown only through `{CHARGENOUN_plural}` and `{lookup: ...}` slots (see the
skill), and the German worker delegates to the English one (lookup, else `+s`) and Core's German `plural.txt` is thin, so any coined noun ships its own `singular;plural` line in `1.6/Languages/German/WordInfo/plural.txt`. Shipcracker's "fuel unit" row in its glossary
is the worked example for this language.

## To ground in the first pass

- siegebreaker (the chassis, lore paragraph 3): the inherited set-name row above.
- the 10th-generation paragraph: no community pack to mirror; follow the meaning, not VFEP's dashes.
- medic (this set's name) and the Workshop title.
- pilot (the wearer, every description), where no inherited row covers it.
- Core medical vocabulary once the abilities exist: tend, medicine, surgery, bleeding, infection, pain, and whatever hediffs or stats the final text names.
- This mod's coinages, once the descriptions are final.

## Pending native review

Inherited from the Shipcracker glossary, still open there: Kriegssarg for
"warcasket" (rejected: Kriegssarkophag, Kriegskapsel, Panzersarg, Kampfsarg,
Kriegsrüstung, the English loan), Kriegssarg-Gießerei, einsargen,
Schulterpanzer, the set names and 'Raumfahrt-Kriegssärge'. Add this mod's own
coinages here as the pass makes them.
